## Dependencies

* `git`
* `npm` or `yarn`
* `vue-cli-service`

### The Vue CLI tool

`vue-cli-service` is a binary that ships with `@vue/cli-service`. Once you have installed this globally, the binary
is exposed and available directly as `vue-cli-service`. If you would prefer to not install it, you can run the app with
`npx`, which comes bundled with `npm`:

```sh
npx vue-cli-service serve
```

## Libraries and tools

* [VueX](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) - For state management
* [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/)
* [Kongponents](https://kongponents.netlify.app/) - An open source Vue component library created by [Kong](https://konghq.com/)
* [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - For making promise-based API requests
* [axios-mock-adapter](https://github.com/ctimmerm/axios-mock-adapter) - For creating mock endpoint data (covered further down)

All styles are written as scoped SCSS inside of each component. For all utility and broader use CSS, styles can be written
in the appropriate place in `src/assets/styles`.

## Folder structure

The GUI is structured in standard Vue app format, with some unique differences.

* public - Contains our Vue app's index file and all static assets
* dist - This is where our build files output to
* tests
* src
  * assets - fonts, images, and all of our SCSS files
  * components - All of our Vue components and skeletons
    * Global - globally-used components (e.g. header, footer, etc)
    * Metrics - These are components for displaying metrics. These are primarily used on the Global Overview
    * Sidebar - The sidebar is comprised of multiple components. They are all located here
    * Skeletons - These views are comprised of multiple components and help keep things DRY when creating new views
    * Utils - Have a small component that serves a generic purpose? This is the ideal place for it
  * mixins
  * pdk - Kong Manager Plugin Development Kit. A handful of components and tools for helping create dashboards quickly
  * schemas
  * services - This is where our REST client and Kuma endpoints reside
  * store - Where all of our VueX modules and store are located
  * views - This is where the majority of our app resides. All route views are located here

## Getting started

### Setting up Kuma

First and foremost, this app depends on [Kuma](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma/) being installed locally and running.
The app will actively look for the API Kuma exposes and it will not run without it. Once the app finds the API endpoint
for fetching data from Kuma, it will store some information in the browser via localStorage so that it can persistently
access it (for things like Kuma's status, version, environment, etc).
The [Kuma installation page](https://kuma.io/install/latest/) will help you get started.

Once you have Kuma running, its API is accessible at `http://localhost:5681/`. If you would like to test it, Meshes
can be found at `http://localhost:5681/meshes`. Kuma creates a `default` Mesh out-of-box.

In production, the GUI is served from `http://localhost:5681/gui/`. In both production and development modes, its API and
config endpoint URLs are derived from the env variable `VUE_APP_KUMA_CONFIG` -- which is found in both `.env.production`
and `.env.development`.

#### Disable anonymous reports

If you are going to be creating a lot of policies, meshes and dataplanes in Kuma to test with the GUI in development mode,
please make sure to disable Kuma's anonymous reports in your profile:

```sh
echo "export KUMA_REPORTS_ENABLED=false" >> ~/.profile
```

### Running the GUI

Now that you've got Kuma itself setup and running, it's time to get the GUI running in development mode from this repository:

```
yarn serve
```

You can now access the GUI at `http://localhost:8080` ðŸŽ‰ ðŸš€

### Building the GUI

To build the GUI for production, use the following command:

```sh
yarn build
```

This will output the build files to `/dist/`.

## Development

The GUI is built on [Vue 2](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/).

A lot of the small components you will see in the GUI are from the open source Vue.js component library
[Kongponents](https://kongponents.netlify.app/). If you are looking for a specific type of component to achieve something,
we recommend looking there first to save time. This also helps keep styles and design consistent.

For larger components, we've created "skeletons" that are composed of multiple smaller components and accept an array of
props for data handling and other functionality. You can see some examples in `src/components/Skeletons`. This keeps things
DRY and more flexible.

The most prominent Skeleton in use is the `DataOverview`. It's used to serve each of the Policies, Meshes, Dataplanes,
and other views that the app serves. We will explain how to create new views.

### Creating a new page view

There are a few steps involved when creating a new view. It will need a route, a component, new REST functions, and a new
nav link in the sidebar.

#### 1. Create your view component

The easiest way to do this is to copy an existing view and rename it accordingly. For example, `CircuitBreakers.vue` would
be a good starting point. Once you've cloned an existing view and named it appropriately, below are the additional changes
to be made:

Change the component name and meta info:

```js
export default {
  name: 'MyNewView',
  metaInfo: {
    title: 'My New View'
  }
}
```

Update the endpoints in the `endpoint` const located in the `loadData()` method:

```js
const mesh = this.$route.params.mesh || null
const query = this.$route.query.ns || null

const params = {
  size: this.pageSize,
  offset: this.pageOffset
}

const endpoint = () => {
  if (mesh === 'all') {
    return this.$api.getAllCircuitBreakers(params)
  } else if ((query && query.length) && mesh !== 'all') {
    return this.$api.getCircuitBreaker(mesh, query, params)
  }

  return this.$api.getAllCircuitBreakersFromMesh(mesh)
}
```

Here is a quick breakdown of what each of these requests does:

* `getAllCircuitBreakers()` - Fetches all Circuit Breakers for all meshes
* `getCircuitBreaker()` - Gets a specific Circuit Breaker from a mesh
* `getAllCircuitBreakersFromMesh()` - Gets all Circuit Breakers for a specific mesh

#### 2. Create your REST functions

All REST functions used throughout the app are located in `src/services/kuma.js`. To make the API accessible globally,
we've defined it as an instance property inside of our `main.js` file, which will import our Kuma service:

```js
const kuma = new Kuma()

Vue.prototype.$api = kuma
```

We won't go into detail about how to create each API function, since this documentation makes the assumption that the reader
has an understanding of Vue concepts. Each existing function is pretty self-explanatory and named in a way that helps describe
what it's doing.

#### 3. Create your route

All Mesh-related view routes are located under the route named `mesh`. Inside of `children: []`
within the `mesh` route, add something like this:

```js
{
  path: 'my-new-view',
  name: 'my-new-view',
  meta: {
    title: 'My New View',
    breadcrumb: 'My New View'
  },
  component: () => import(/* webpackChunkName: "my-new-view" */ '@/views/Entities/MyNewView')
},
```
Your route will look like this: `http://localhost:8080/#/:mesh/my-new-view`. `:mesh` is a route `param` that is
replaced with the mesh that the user has selected in the app (this defaults to `all`, which shows data for all Meshes).

#### 4. Create your sidebar menu link

All of the sidebar menu items are located in `src/components/Sidebar/menu.js`. If you are creating a view for a new Service,
place your link inside of `items` within `subNav`:

```js
subNav: {
  items: [
    {
      name: 'My New View',
      link: 'my-new-view' // this is the `name` of your route
    }
  ]
}
```

If you are instead creating a new title to divide your nav items, you can do this:

```js
{
  name: 'My Group Name',
  title: true
}
```

If you have a route that requires the `:mesh` to be inserted at the end of the URL instead of before your route's path,
you can use the `pathFlip` boolean to enable this:

```js
{
  name: 'Meshes',
  link: 'mesh-child',
  pathFlip: true
}
```

**What does `pathFlip` do?**

By default, the format for URLs is `/default/meshes` -- `default` being the selected Mesh name, and `meshes`
being the path for our route. But say you wanted the Mesh to be at the end instead (like in the context of the Meshes
view). Your route would instead be structured like so: `/meshes/default`

### Creating mock data

For handling mock data, we use [msw](https://github.com/mswjs/msw).

**NOTE: Mocking is enabled by default.** If you need to disable this in order to see only data coming from Kuma itself:

1. Stop the app with `ctrl+c`
2. change `VUE_APP_MOCK_API_ENABLED` to `false` in `.env.development`
3. Restart the app

#### Creating and modifying mocks

All of our mock data is located in `src/services/mock.js`. We recommend reading the
[documentation](https://mswjs.io/docs/getting-started/mocks) for msw to get an understanding
on how it works and what it has to offer.

Right now, our mock file is quite large. If you are so inclined and would like to help us organize it better, please feel
free to [open a PR](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma-gui/pulls) to split it up into more manageable chunks.

### VueX store / State management

All of our app state management functionality is located in `src/store/index.js`. In the future, we would like to split
this file up to make it more manageable ([learn more](https://vueschool.io/lessons/split-vuex-store-in-multiple-files)).

One of the main things you'll need when adding a view for a new Policy, is a way to count the number of items within that
policy. By default, each endpoint served from Kuma includes a `total`. Here is an example:

**Our action:**

```js
fetchProxyTemplateTotalCount ({ commit }) {
  // we supply a size of 1 to keep the request lightweight.
  // by default, each endpoint will return 100 items, but since we simply want to get the total,
  // we can tell it to just give us 1 item.
  const params = { size: 1 }

  return api.getAllProxyTemplates(params)
    .then(response => {
      const total = response.total

      // once we have our total, we write it to our state with a mutation
      commit('SET_TOTAL_PROXY_TEMPLATE_COUNT', total)
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.error(error)
    })
},
```

The above will get the total number of Proxy Templates from the endpoint, and then triggers a mutation to update our state:

**Our mutation:**

```js
SET_TOTAL_PROXY_TEMPLATE_COUNT: (state, count) => (state.totalProxyTemplateCount = count)
```

This simply updates the total number of Proxy Templates in the state. If you're already familiar with VueX or state
management, this is straightforward.

**Our getter:**

We also have getters for grabbing this data with ease:

```js
getTotalProxyTemplateCount: (state) => state.totalProxyTemplateCount
```

In your component, you can then use [`mapGetters`](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/getters.html#the-mapgetters-helper)
as a computed value for easily accessing this data:

```js
import { mapGetters } from 'vuex'

export default {
  // [...]
  computed: {
    ...mapGetters({
      total: 'getTotalProxyTemplateCount'
    }),
  }
}
```

```html
<!-- your component -->
<div>
  <h1>Total: {{ total }}</h1>
</div>
```

We recommend taking a look at the Overview (`src/views/Overview.vue`) component to get a better understanding of where and
how these total counts are used.

### Styles

We try to primarily follow the [BEMCSS](http://getbem.com/introduction/) methodology when writing CSS, but since we are
writing mostly scoped styles on all of our Vue components, our naming conventions can be more relaxed. Please make sure
to name your elements in a clear manner.

#### Variables

When working with [Kongponents](https://kongponents.netlify.app/), you'll see that
[CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) are used heavily. This
allows styles in components to be overridden with ease.
[Here is an example](https://kongponents.netlify.app/components/button.html#theming) of how button variables can be
overridden without having to do hacky `!important` or `.class-name.class-name` hacks:

```js
<template>
  <KButton
    class="purple-button"
    appearance="primary"
    @click="someCoolEvent"
  >
    PURPLE!
  </KButton>
</template>

<style>
.purple-button {
  --KButtonPrimaryBase: #494ca2;
  --KButtonPrimaryHover: #6c6ebd;
  --KButtonPrimaryActive: #3c3f86;
}
</style>
```

The same applies to our GUI app. All of our global and component-specific CSS variables are stored within
`src/assets/styles/variables.scss`. You'll notice that there are some SCSS variables present as well. This is so we can
leverage some of the built-in color modification functions that Sass offers.

#### Scoped SCSS

When writing styles inside of a component, make sure to include `scoped` to prevent style collisions:

```js
<style lang="scss" scoped>
.your-component {
  color: rebeccapurple;

  // try not to go more than 3 elements deep when nesting
  .nested-item {
    display: block;
  }
}
</style>
```

If you are writing broader styles in a CSS/SCSS file, make sure to leverage BEM. This helps keep things clear and concise:

```css
.main-sidebar { }
.main-sidebar__nav-link { }
.main-sidebar__nav-link--is-active { }
.main-sidebar__title { }
```

#### State

When handling states in CSS, we like to use human-readable classes to make it obvious that a certain state is applied or
active. This helps when scanning through the codebase, and helps with debugging as well. Here are some examples:

```css
.is-expanded { }
.is-active { }
.is-fixed { }
```

#### Tailwind

In an effort to help with rapid development and avoid reinventing the wheel, we use some [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
utilities throughout the app. If you need to revise or view the configuration for Tailwind, this is handled in the
`tailwind.config.js` file.

All of our needed Tailwind components are included with the `src/assets/styles/third-party/tailwind.css` file:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
