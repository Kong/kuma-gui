      info:
        zone-cps: Some of the Zone CPs are either offline or disabled. A reason for that could be that the Zone CPs are not properly connected to the Global CP and the versions are compatible.
        dpps: Some of the Data Plane Proxies are offline. Consider adding the Mesh Health Check policy to collect more information about the health of Data Plane Proxies.
        services: Some of the services are offline. Consider adding Service Health Probes to collect more information about the health of the services.
