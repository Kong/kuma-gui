        A zone requires both the zone control plane and zone ingress. On Kubernetes, you run a single command to create both resources. On Universal, you must create them separately.

        **See <a href="{KUMA_DOCS_URL}/production/deployment/multi-zone/?{KUMA_UTM_QUERY_PARAMS}" target="_blank">the documentation for options to install</a>.**
