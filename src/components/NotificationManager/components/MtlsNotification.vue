      Zero-trust security becomes even more critical as you transition to a microservice architecture.
      Microservices can be a chance to make your systems more secure than they were with monolithic applications.
      To do so, you use a zero-trust security model to encrypt traffic and reduce the risk of breaches,
      including mTLS and traffic permissions ACL to secure traffic paths from one service to another
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      {{ productName }} is one service mesh that you can deploy once across any zone, cloud or cluster,
      including a Kubernetes cluster. Then, on top of this one service mesh implementation, you can create as many
      virtual service meshes as you wantâ€”each backed by its certificate authority.
    </p>
    <div class="mb-4">
      <p class="mb-2">
        This is the fastest and simplest way to enable mTLS in {{ productName }}.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
        With a <code class="inline">builtin</code> CA backend type, {{ productName }} will dynamically generate its own
        CA root certificate and key that it uses to automatically provision (and rotate) certificates for every replica
        of every service.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
        We can specify more than one <code class="inline">builtin</code> backend with different names, and each one of
        them will be automatically provisioned with a unique pair of certificate + key (they are not shared).
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
        To enable a <code class="inline">builtin</code> mTLS for the entire Mesh we can apply the
        following configuration:
